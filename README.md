# Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a complete trajectory tracking pipeline for a differential-drive mobile robot inside NVIDIA Isaac Sim, integrated seamlessly with ROS2 Humble. The goal was to generate smooth motion trajectories, visualize them, and control the robot to accurately follow the planned path in a simulated environment.

# SOftware Configurations
